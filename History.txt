=== 1.1.0 / 2012-01-18 / nhruby@gmail.com

* use vars for extract file and dirname, intrduces new suggested setting :extract_file to deploy.rb
* switch to using rsync from remote_task instead of scp
* switch handling of push and compress steps around to resolve issues pushing to multiple hosts

=== 1.0.1 / 2011-07-21

* Updating README.txt to include examples for deploy.rb and Rakefile
* Removing vlad-git as a dependancy
* Including TODOs here:
** TODO: update to use "scm" directory over "/tmp"
** TODO: update to use vlad date based versioning for better code management and rollback.
** TODO: update push_cleanup to keep previous 5 version, like vlad does -- maybe?
** TODO: add ability to specify local storage for compressed packages.
** TODO: include rsync as an option over ssh for faster pushes -- someday, but probably not soon.
** TODO: include zip as an option over tar, for windows users -- someday.
** TODO: allow users to specify tar/zip location explicitly.

=== 1.0.0 / 2011-07-20

* The first two release were terrible, buggy and didn't do what they said the did. I have updated to this to not use any form of scm and should actually work for all *nix and Mac OS 10+ with ssh and tar.
